# IMPORTANT!! SECURITY STUFF!! Please read! (Yes, the entire thing...)
#
# SafeDrive relies on GPG symmetrical encryption to encrypt your data to store it
# safely. What this means in plain English is that your files are encrypted with a key,
# and you can only recover your documents by decrypting with the same key. So it is
# critical that you never lose or forget the passphrase you set here, or you will never
# be able to restore your backups!!!
#
# Remember that in the event of data loss on this computer, it is likely this file will
# be gone too. You will not be able to look up your password in this file if that 
# happens! The best passphrase is one you will never forget and one people can't easily
# guess. "My dog's name is Mandy" is not a good passphrase, because someone could guess
# it. Personal is fine, but make it less easy to just guess. "I love it when Mandy eats
# blue popsicles, she makes such funny faces!" for example would be much better.
#
# The minimum length SafeDrive will accept is 10 characters, but really you should
# make it much longer. It is easier than you might think. Here, let me show you:
#
# Good passphrase policy:
# * Use a *phrase* instead of a word with numbers and symbols, which would just
#   be difficult to remember and easier to crack. You can remember a fairly long
#   sentence without a problem if it's funny or tells a story, and random
#   sentences are almost impossible to crack. Humans are capable of being very
#   random and unpredictable, why not make good use of it? :)
#
# * Make it a sentence that is very unlikely to ever be written by anyone else.
#   People use Twitter and Facebook to scan for phrases to crack passwords with!
#
# * Don't use phrases from movies or books, these are standard to check for. No,
#   "this is not the password you are looking for" is not a good passphrase. Sorry!
#
# * Mess it up a bit so it's not just dictionary words. This is less important than
#   all the above, but it doesn't hurt to use chikin instead of chicken for example.
#
# * Don't reuse it anywhere.
#
# * Don't use the phrase below, it's now going to be in every passphrase dictionary
#   ever. You might as well use 1234567890 instead (please don't do that!).
#
# Finally, make sure no one but you has access to this file!! If you let SafeDrive
# have access to any root owned files, anyone who has access to this file will be
# able to effectively get to those files as well through your backups. If you run
# SafeDrive as root, then make sure this file is only readable by root too!
#
# Passphrase = I reckon dis here be a purdy gud phrase, dontcha think, miss chikin?
Passphrase = testinghere
 
# Maximum filesize (pre-compression) to back up, in kilobytes. Defaults to -1,
# which will disable this feature. Anything larger than the maximum will be
# ignored entirely. Note that SafeDrive needs to read each file into memory so make
# sure you have enough RAM available if you choose to disable this feature.
# Current setting is 200 MB (200 * 1024kb)
MaxFileSize = 204800

# Verbosity levels:
# 0: Off, no output
# 1: Only output errors
# 2: Errors and warnings
# 3: Errors, warnings and info messages
# 4: Debug output

# Do you prefer to trust the server's database of available files over the local
# database if they mismatch? Having the correct database is needed for SafeDrive
# to be able to restore files with correct filenames into their original folders.
#
# The database on the server side is encrypted and it is almost impossible that
# someone has successfully tampered with it, so we trust it more by default.
#
# If the database on the server side has been corrupted and cannot be decrypted
# anymore and the signatures also mismatch, then SafeDrive will assume it was done
# intentionally as sabotage and will attempt its best rebuild the database. Data
# related to revisions will be lost. The local database as it was will be backed
# up for you to review later.
#
# If you suspect someone could tamper with the database to cause you to lose data
# related to revisions, it is advisable to back up the encrypted version to USB or
# even your phone to keep with you.
#
# You can always decrypt the files even if you lose the database, SafeDrive simply
# won't know what to call the files or where to put them.
TrustServer = true

# If the local and server databases do not match, quit backing up altogether? This
# means no files will be backed up by SafeDrive at all anymore until the issue has
# been resolved. If you constantly monitor the logs or get SD's output e-mailed by
# the cron daemon, this is a viable option. You get to decide for yourself which
# file has been modified or corrupted and what action to take. Defaults to false.
# Overrides TrustServer.
QuitOnMismatch = false

# If this setting is set to true, the remote database will be downloaded after it
# has been uploaded. It will then be decrypted and compared to the local database
# to confirm the integrity of it. Defaults to false.
DoubleCheck = false

# Which folder should we look in for files to back up? And how?
# You can have up to 255 backup targets.
#
# Examples:
# ---------
#
# [Backup]
# Name = Fluffy's Pictures
# Directory = /home/user/pictures/fluffy
#
# [Backup]
# Name = My Super Awesome Project
# Directory = /home/user/project
# Filetypes = c, cpp, h, hpp
# AlsoThese = Makefile, README, stuff.txt
# IgnoreTildes = true
# KeepRevisions = true
# Recursive = true
# Compress = true
#
# Recursive defaults to true.
# KeepRevisions defaults to true.
# Compress defaults to true. This is great for text documents and binaries, but
# useless for most images and movies as they are already compressed. Uses GPGs
# own compression algorithm.
#
# IgnoreTildes defaults to true. When set to true it ignores files which end in ~,
# these are usually generated by editors as backups for files you have edited.
# It's usually OK to let SafeDrive ignore them if you're unsure.
#
# If you do not use the Filetypes setting it will default to using all files, but if
# you specifically want files without extensions just use "Filetypes = ". Note that
# file names and types are case sensitive. If you wanted to back up certain files
# with an extension and also all without, you would just specify an empty filetype
# like this:
#
# Filetypes = , c, cpp, h, hpp
